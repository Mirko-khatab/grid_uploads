                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, if not more so, in the company I joined.
                I
                honestly feel I got every penny's worth.

                " I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp. I've been looking to make a transition and have heard
                some
                people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I
                enrolled
                shortly thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since completing the
                course,
                I've successfully switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. "

" Before joining the bootcamp, I've never written a line of code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to
the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it during interviews as an
example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
multiple offers. 100% recommend! "

    Awesome teaching support from TAs who did the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
    experiences was easy.
